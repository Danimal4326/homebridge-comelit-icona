# Comelit HUB integration for Homebridge

![Comelit](https://github.com/madchicken/homebridge-comelit-hub/raw/master/images/comelit.png)

This is an Homebridge platform plugin to exppose Comelit ICONA features to HK.
The code is based on the reverse engineering of the official protocol, so expect bugs.

The plugin currently supports only listing and opening connected doors/gates.
